This is a library for complex, optional, indexing agents. New ones might be added. Old ones
might fall out of use.

There is a separate directory deeper in the code base, alongside the module that calls these,
that contains some builtin, permanent, always used, indexing agents, eg, for auditing.

To invoke these requires an entry in the config, systemParameterrs.ini. The other ones
do not. They are always invoked.
